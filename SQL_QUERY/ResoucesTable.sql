('TXDOT SH71 and Shared Use Path',9,'The Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) plans to design and construct toll lanes on SH71 from Presidential Boulevard to a point just east of SH 130 in Austin. The Project is part of a series of improvements intended to complete a highway upgrade to SH 71. The Project is dedicated to improving mobility along SH 71 in a safe, efficient, and reliable manner. This Project would include improvements to make the area more bicycle and pedestrian friendly. A component of this Project is to add 5.1 miles of a 10 feet wide pedestrian path for walking and/or cycling (Shared Use Path) along the SH 71 frontage roads of which 1.2 miles of that is on Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (Airport) property.  The Shared Use Path located on Airport property will begin at Spirit of Texas Drive and end just east of Terry Lane.  The Shared Use Path may include low-level lighting and landscaping subject to Airport height and wildlife attractant restrictions.        The estimated cost for the Shared Use Path on Airport property is $1,138,814.  TXDOT intends to fully finance the design and construction of the Project and no City financing is required.  TXDOT expects the Project to be completed by December 2016.  Upon completion, the City will own and maintain the Shared Use Path on Airport property.  The City’s Urban Trails program will maintain and repair the Shared Use Path on Airport property as needed.   ','ABAI-1'),
